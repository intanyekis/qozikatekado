It would be fascinating to hear what Frances Bean Cobain and Riley Hawk have to say about the term. When fans found out that the couple was dating in February 2022, it was exciting. They definitely have experience growing up with parents who the entire world knows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There's no doubt that Cobain and Hawk's backgrounds bring them attention. But both are talented and can be praised on their own merits. Hawk is an incredible pro skateboarder and has a band called Warish. And Cobain is a great artist who has also modeled. Fans might have expected Cobain to start her own <strong><a href=#>music</a> </strong>career given the legacy that Kurt Cobain left. While she has written some songs, she hasn't released an album... at least not yet.</p><p>Riley Hawk and Frances Bean Cobain definitely keep their relationship private. Fans have one burning question: is the couple still together?</p><h2 id=are-riley-hawk-and-frances-bean-cobain-still-dating>Are Riley Hawk And Frances Bean Cobain Still Dating?</h2><p>A lot of attention has been paid to <a href=#>Frances Bean Cobain and Courtney Love's hard relationship</a>. And when fans learned that Frances Bean Cobain and Riley Hawk were dating, that was of course huge news.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cobain shared the relationship news</a> on her Instagram account. According to People, she posted in February 2022, "I took a year long break from posting on Instagram which was exceptionally good for my mental, emotional & spiritual health. 2021 brought me more into the present moment than I've ever been, which I'm deeply grateful for."</p><p>Cobain shared several pictures, including a few that included Riley Hawk. People reported that one of the photos included Riley's mom Catherine Goodman and dad Tony Hawk.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/frances-bean-cobain.jpg><p>Cobain continued in the caption, "I wanted to share a few moments that were captured / created this past year that brought me a great amount of joy."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Inherited More From Kurt Cobain: Frances Bean Or Courtney Love?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Are Frances Bean Cobain and Riley Hawk still dating? It's very possible that they are. However, Cobain hasn't said anything since her Instagram post in February 2022. And Hawk hasn't spoken about their romance, either. If the couple has broken up, neither one seems to want to tell the public about it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/frances-bean-cobain.jpg><p>Cobain's most recent Instagram post was in May 2023 and included a beautiful piece of art that her friend created. Before that, she posted about Japan in April 2023.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seems possible that Cobain and Hawk were still dating in August 2022. This is because Cobain posted a message on her 30th birthday and Tony Hawk commented on it. She wrote, "Entering this new decade I hope to stay soft no matter how hardening the world can feel at times, bask in the present moment with reverence, shower the people I am lucky enough to love with more appreciation than words could ever do justice & hold space to keep learning, so the growth never stops."</p><p>Tony Hawk wished Frances Bean a happy birthday. If she and Riley had split up by then, it seems unlikely that he would have commented. However, it's still possible.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Frances Bean Cobain Have To Go Back To Work After Blowing Through $11 Million Of Kurt Cobain's Net Worth?</a></span></p><p>While Riley Hawk is private about his relationship with Frances Bean Cobain, he does talk about his skateboarding career. He definitely seems to share the same passion that his dad has. And he seems comfortable sharing how he feels about having a celebrity parent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/riley-hawk.jpg><p>When Riley Hawk was interviewed by The Nine Club, he talked about being Tony Hawk's child. The video is available on YouTube and features a very honest conversation. Riley Hawk said, "It's not that I hated it, I don't like attention like that. I've never said to anyone, like, 'my dad's Tony Hawk.'" He said that sometimes, people would ask if he was related to Tony Hawk. When he said yes, they would say that they didn't believe him. Riley Hawk explained that he "just didn't care" if people knew who he was.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's possible that Hawk and Cobain can relate to each other because they both have such famous parents. And since neither one has talked about their relationship, perhaps they both decided to keep their relationship mostly secret. Of course, Cobain did share photos of Hawk on her Instagram. She definitely knew that people would figure out that they were dating. But she seems to have decided not to say anything more.</p><h2 id=who-have-riley-hawk-and-frances-bean-cobain-dated-in-the-past>Who Have Riley Hawk And Frances Bean Cobain Dated In The Past?</h2><p>Riley Hawk's relationship history is unknown. It's possible that he has had girlfriends besides Frances Bean Cobain. If he has, he has been super private about them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/riley-hawk-tony-hawk.jpg><p>Riley Hawk is fairly private about most things in his life. He always seems game to be interviewed, but he likes to keep the spotlight on his work as a pro skateboarder. It's understandable that after growing up with a famous parent, Riley wouldn't want to talk much about who he's dating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's What Frances Bean Cobain Really Thinks Of Her Parents</a></span></p><p>Not much is known about Hawk's life besides the fact that he's a skateboarder, just like his dad Tony Hawk. According to Celebrity Net Worth, he has a $2 million net worth. Since he is 30 years old, it's possible to guess that Hawk has had at least a few relationships prior to dating Frances Bean Cobain. If his ex-partners aren't famous, it would have been easy to keep those romances out of the spotlight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/frances-bean-cobain-1.jpg><p>There's much more information available about Frances Bean Cobain's past partners. According to Ranker, Cobain and Isaiah Silva got married. But in 2017, after they had been together for seven years, they split up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After that, Cobain and Matthew Cook began a relationship. Cook is a member of The Ceremonies. The divorce was challenging, that's for sure. According to People, Silva was able to keep the guitar that Kurt Cobain played during his infamous MTV Unplugged session. Even though Frances Bean really wanted to get it back, Silva said that it was a present.</p><p>If Frances Bean Cobain and Riley Hawk are still seeing each other, then they have been a couple for over a year. Fans definitely hope that they are still together and happy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dm7%2BiusKeqmaalZa7bq%2FOm5iipl2Wu6V50aKjnrFdna64t4ysq6KknGLBsLPErZ%2Beql2nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr1uus6wZg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./duchess-kate-prince-william-beam-in-blue-at-2019-wimbledon-final.html>&#171;&nbsp;Duchess Kate, Prince William Beam in Blue at 2019 Wimbledon Final</a>
