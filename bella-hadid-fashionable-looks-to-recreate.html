Because of her involvement with modeling for now-regarded nostalgic brands like Tommy Hilfiger and Marc Jacobs and her chic off-duty street style, a lot of the younger generation, specifically Gen Z, has hailed her as a fashion icon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the years, many of Bella Hadid’s outfits have managed to look timelessly fashionable.

The supermodel would later be seen <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wearing this street style ensemble out and about during 2022 New York Fashion Week</a>, as reported by W Magazine, with a black button-up and purse added to the outfit. Simple closet essentials are all anyone needs to recreate this look.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Bella And Gigi Hadid Donate All Fashion Week Earnings to Ukraine Relief</a></span></p><h2 id=her-90s-inspired-denim-on-denim-street-style><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Her 90s-Inspired Denim-On-Denim Street Style</span></h2><p>The denim-on-denim look was all the rage in the 90s with popular celebrities of the time like Britney Spears and TLC embracing the monochromatic layering fashion. With Y2K coming back in style, it’s evident that Bella may have turned to that era for some fashion inspiration. In her early September 2022 Instagram pic, which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she wore to the U.S. Open Tennis Championships</a> in August according to reporting from Grazia, Bella wore a corset dark wash denim top, cuffed low-rise baggy jeans of the same color, and some black and white sneakers.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Bella Hadid’s 10 Best Instagram Outfits</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since we’re guessing you have at least one denim type of clothing in your closet, this Bella Hadid 90s style can be easily recreated with items you already own. Try pairing up your own dark-wash jeans with a denim jacket of the same color. Or swap it out for a denim crop top if you have one. And if you’re dying to get a top similar to what Bella has, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zara's Denim Corset Top</a> is a pretty good match!</p><h2 id=bella-39-s-totally-tubular-80s-inspired-dress-and-leg-warmers><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Bella's Totally Tubular 80s-Inspired Dress And Leg Warmers</span></h2><p>The 90s isn’t the only decade Bella Hadid seems to take inspiration from! Bella showcased her 80s-inspired outfit on her Instagram in early September 2022, taking various pictures posing in a high-neck striped dress and pink leg warmers. Of course, Bella modernized the look to fit her street style, as she wore some square shades and bright blue pumps to go along with it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Bella Hadid's 10 Best Street Fashion Looks</a></span></p><p>In case you are wondering, Bella's particular dress is from Chanel, which unfortunately seems to be sold out on their official website. Fortunately, however, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ASOS DESIGN's Knitted Mini Dress In Multi Stripe</a> is pretty similar to Bella’s dress. And as for the rest of the outfit recreation, all you need is some legwarmers—which you can easily <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">find on Amazon</a>—and heels.</p><h2 id=get-biker-chic-with-bella-39-s-all-leather-outfit-she-wore-at-fendi-39-s-after-party><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Get Biker Chic With Bella's All Leather Outfit She Wore At Fendi's After Party</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you’re looking for an edgier outfit from Bella’s to recreate, her all-black and leather outfit she wore to Fendi’s after party during 2022 New York Fashion Week might be right up your alley. Wearing a shrug, corset, and pleated skirt, the model strutted into the event in footwear which looked to be a hybrid of knee-high boots and Nike sneakers. Designed by Ancute Sarca, the shoe was arguably one of the most eye-catching parts of Bella’s outfit. If you’re looking to get the shoe for your outfit recreation, a similar style by the same designer can be found online at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harvey Nicolas</a>.</p><h2 id=or-cottagecore-like-bella-39-s-outfit-she-wore-in-holland><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Or Cottagecore, Like Bella's Outfit She Wore In Holland</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cottagecore has truly become hallmarked as one of the popular fashion aesthetics of 2022 and with that came the return of the corset—one of Bella’s signature clothing pieces next to baggy jeans and sneakers. In a late August 2022 Instagram carousel, Bella was wandering the streets of Holland wearing a blush pink off-the-shoulder top under a white corset accented with pink ribbons over, classic light-washed baggy pants, and squared-toed high heels with socks. Bella completed the look with a black cross bag with metallic holes leading down its strap.</p><p>Since corsets are in again, which according to The New York Times credits to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their design being more wearable and less costume-y</a> part of the reason, you probably have a pretty high chance of finding one in order to recreate this whimsical Bella Hadid look. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Micas' Lace Seam Detail Corset Top</a> gives off the same cottagecore vibes as Bella’s.

Though if you have a favorite floral dress of your own, that could also work just as well for this Bella Hadid-inspired look.</p><h2 id=bella-39-s-paris-outfit-also-makes-for-the-perfect-back-to-school-fit><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Bella's Paris Outfit Also Makes For The Perfect Back-To-School Fit</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This collared sweater and plaid skirt combo Bella wore during her trip to Paris is not only a good look to recreate, but is a great <a href=#>fall fashion inspo for back-to-school</a>!

Bella's look during the 2022 Paris Fashion Week gave off some punk rock vibes! In her mid-March 2022 Instagram carousel, one of the outfits Bella wore consisted of a high-neck white t-shirt layered under a black off-the-shoulder puff-sleeve top, and a purple and green plaid skirt held up by a leather belt with a pocket and some silver chains. Keeping up with the punk-inspired look, Bella finished off her outfit by wearing some chunky leather black boots.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you're into more punk fashion, this would be an especially fun look to recreate.
