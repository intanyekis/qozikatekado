Of course, that makes a lot of sense since some people have managed to <a href=#>turn their lives around by winning the lottery</a>. On top of that, there is something undeniably attractive about pulling off the kind of robbery that can be seen in <a href=#>the best heist movies</a> assuming that violence isn’t involved.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Money Heist': Which Cast Member Made The Most Amount Of Money?</a></span></p><p>No matter how cool it might seem to win the lottery or pull off a heist, there is something truly special about the idea of finding sunken or buried treasure. As a result, a show like The Curse of Oak Island which focuses on a pair of brothers exploring an island where treasure is supposed to be stashed can become popular enough to be on the air for years. Since The Curse of Oak Island fans have watched the Lagina brothers follow the legend of the island for years, they may be shocked to learn they don’t really need the money they could find someday. After all, it turns out that Rick Lagina actually is worth a small fortune already.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-money-is-rick-lagina-actually-worth>How Much Money Is Rick Lagina Actually Worth?</h2><p>As of the time of this writing, the ninth season of The Curse of Oak Island is in the middle of airing. On top of that, the show has been popular enough to spawn two spin-offs to date, The Curse of Oak Island: Drilling Down and Beyond Oak Island. In between those three shows and a pair of other series Rick Lagina has appeared in, he has been a part of more than 185 episodes of television that have aired on a notable television channel.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Curse Of Oak Island: 15 Things Most People Don't Know About The Show</a></span></p><p>In this day and age, <a href=#>the highest-paid TV stars</a> get paid so much money that it is pretty obscene. However, it should go without saying that The Curse of Oak Island has never been one of the highest-rated television shows. For that reason, there is no doubt that Rick Lagina doesn’t get paid the kind of money that the biggest TV stars make. Still, after appearing in so many episodes of TV, it also is certain that Rick has been paid a good amount of money for his time as a “reality” show star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of being a “reality” show star, Rick Lagina has been a businessman for many years as of this point. After discovering the legend of Oak Island in the pages of a Reader’s Digest when he was only 11-years-old, Rick went on to co-own the Oak Island Tours company with his brother Marty. Since that company is the majority owner of Oak Island itself, the brothers have been able to cash in on people who are willing to pay to explore it.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Curse Of Oak Island: Everything We Learned In 2020</a></span></p><p>Thanks to his television and business success, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rick has a $10 million fortune</a> according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-money-is-marty-lagina-actually-worth>How Much Money Is Marty Lagina Actually Worth?</h2><p>In any group of siblings, there inherently is one of them who is the richest. However, in a lot of those cases, it is unclear which one of the siblings that actually is since people often aren’t entirely honest when talking about how much money they have. When it comes to Rick and Mary Lagina, however, if the reports about their respective fortunes are accurate, it is very which one of them has a lot more money than the other.</p><p>Even though Rick Lagina can rest easy knowing that he has an impressive fortune, it turns out that his net worth is dwarfed by his brother Marty’s. The reason for that is when Marty was a younger man, he founded the company Terra Energy which “was a pioneer in extracting natural gas from shale around the mid-west in the 1990s”. After turning heads in the business, Marty was approached by CMS Energy and he agreed to sell Terra Energy to them for a staggering $58 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not ready to rest on his laurels, after Mary Lagina sold his first massively successful business, he decided to start a new venture in the energy industry. The second time around, however, Marty invested in wind energy by founding <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heritage Sustainable which has launched 11 renewable energy facilities</a> to date and plans to further expand in the future. With that in mind, it seems all but certain that Marty’s fortune will continue to expand in the years to come. Given the fact that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marty already has a $100 million fortune</a> according to celebritynetworth.com, it is amazing to think about how rich he might still become.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>15 Facts From The Set Of History Channel's The Curse Of Oak Island</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipopubYrmis8inmGamlal6uLvRrZ9mrJiaeqTB0aycZqeWYryit4yiqqWZnpl8</p></div><div id=links><a href=./snoop-dogg-doesnt-drink-alcohol-brands-endorses-1234795586.html>&#171;&nbsp;Snoop Dogg Doesn't Drink The Alcohol Brands He Endorses</a>
