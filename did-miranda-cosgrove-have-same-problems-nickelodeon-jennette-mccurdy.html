Aside from launching Ariana Grande into stardom, the kids' channel also introduced fans to both Miranda Cosgrove and Jennette McCurdy, both of whom starred in the highly successful show iCarly. Since the show ended in 2012, the actresses have gone on to pursue separate acting projects with both landing TV and movie roles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And while Cosgrove and McCurdy could have reunited in the iCarly reboot show on Paramount+, <a href=#>only Cosgrove has returned to reprise her titular role</a>. McCurdy, meanwhile, <a href=#>recently published a memoir</a> that detailed some shocking revelations about her time on Nickelodeon, among others. And while Cosgrove herself has spoken out about her own time with the channel, it’s become clear that actresses’ experiences couldn’t be more different.</p><h2 id=miranda-cosgrove-felt-lsquo-pressure-rsquo-while-working-on-the-original-icarly>Miranda Cosgrove Felt ‘Pressure’ While Working On The Original iCarly</h2><p>When iCarly originally premiered in 2007, Cosgrove was just 14 and essentially new to it all. Sure, she’s had some roles here and there. But this time, she was the star and Cosgrove was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">aware that it came with expectations</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“For sure there was pressure,” the actress admitted while speaking on the Reign with Josh Smith podcast. “Even when you’re not on TV or acting or anything, just growing up, there’s a lot of pressure to try to figure so many things out.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Are Jennette McCurdy And Miranda Cosgrove Still Friends Today?</a></span></p><p>Since then, however, Cosgrove has gained a new perspective. “I feel like when I was younger, I didn’t think about it as much as I do now,” the actress explained.</p><p>“Looking back, I think, ‘That seems like it would’ve been really hard.’ But when I was doing it, I wasn’t really thinking about it as much. I was more just kind of living my life.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That said, when the opportunity came to do iCarly again, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosgrove had some hesitations at first</a>. For starters, she struggled with the idea of doing a show for a demographic that’s younger than her character today.</p><p>Fortunately, they eventually figured it out. “We talked about doing this show and making sure it was actually more adult and that it was for the people that watched the original,” Cosgrove explained.</p><p>“Originally, when we were trying to recreate what the show used to be and have it be for younger people, that was a struggle.”</p><h2 id=jennette-mccurdy-revealed-she-suffered-lsquo-emotional-abuse-rsquo-while-filming-nickelodeon-shows>Jennette McCurdy Revealed She Suffered ‘Emotional Abuse’ While Filming Nickelodeon Shows</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When iCarly ended, McCurdy went on to star in Nickelodeon’s Sam & Cat. At that time, it was the latest show from iCarly showrunner Dan Schneider and this time around, the Los Angeles native would be the lead star.</p><p>And just when fans thought that Sam & Cat would be McCurdy’s most successful show yet, the actress found herself dealing with “emotional abuse,” among other things.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Is Why Miranda Cosgrove Stopped Singing (And Returned To Acting)</a></span></p><p>In her memoir, I’m Glad My Mom Died, McCurdy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recalls her experience on the show</a> while also revealing how she was treated by a figure she only referred to as “The Creator,” which is presumed to be Schneider.</p><p>For instance, the actress revealed that she was encouraged to drink by the Creator while on set. “The Victorious kids get drunk together all the time. The iCarly kids are so wholesome. We need to give you guys a little edge," he reportedly told her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>McCurdy also revealed that The Creator gave her an unwanted back massage. “My shoulders do have a lot of knots in them, but I don’t want The Creator to be the one rubbing them out,” the actress wrote.</p><p>“I want to say something, to tell him to stop, but I’m so scared of offending him.”</p><p>Later on, she also revealed that the unnamed person “has gotten in trouble from the network for accusations of his emotional abuse. I feel like it’s been a long time coming, and should have happened a lot sooner.”</p><p>Despite this, however, the said figure continued to work from the show, although he was no longer allowed to be on set with the actors.</p><p>Instead, he was confined to a “small cave-like room off to the side of the soundstage, surrounded by piles of cold cuts, his favorite snack, and Kids’ Choice Awards, his most cherished life accomplishment.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Miranda Cosgrove Revealed What It Was Like Growing Up On Nickelodeon</a></span></p><p>And later on, when McCurdy learned the show was canceled, she also revealed that Nickelodeon offered her $300,000.</p><p>“They’re giving you three hundred thousand dollars and the only thing they want you to do is never talk publicly about your experience at Nickelodeon,” one of the actress’ managers allegedly said.</p><p>McCurdy also confirmed in her book that Nickelodeon didn’t want her to say anything “specifically related to The Creator.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Paramount+ has already renewed iCarly for a third season so fans can expect to see more of Cosgrove. As for McCurdy, it seems that the actress has decided to take a break from acting for now.</p><p>“I want my life to be in my hands,” she wrote in her memoir. “Not an eating disorder’s or a casting director’s or an agent’s or my mom’s.
