The lavish property has 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, as well as a private elevator and entrance. Zendaya, whose net worth is already $15 million, has been supplementing her income by renting out the Brooklyn property for $16,000 per month.</p><p>Zendaya’s current residence is nothing less than spectacular, as she has chosen a $4 million secluded house in Los Angeles that is spread across four acres and has 5000 square feet of living space. The mansion was built in 1939 and will cost far more than the initial price.</p><p>Aside from these, Zendaya owns a Lexus Gs worth $50,000, a Cadillac Escalade, a Lexus RC, a Mercedes E Class, and a Range Rover Vogue, all of which are expensive. The total cost of her vehicles is estimated to be around $350,000.</p><h2>Zendaya’s Earnings</h2><p>Zendaya, the sensational actress, earns approximately $220,000 per month, which amounts to $2.5 million per year. The calculation is a rough estimate of Zendaya’s pre-tax income.</p><p>Zendaya was said to have demanded a higher salary during the filming of Euphoria, making her the highest-paid cast member, with a fee of $50,000 per episode.</p><p>She was paid $30,000 for Dune Part 1 and is expected to raise her demand before Dune 2. Zendaya made a fortune from Spiderman alone, and she was paid $400,000 for each season of KC Undercover.</p><h2>Zendaya Early Life</h2><p></p><p>Zendaya Coleman was born Zendaya Maree Stoermer Coleman in Oakland, California on September 1, 1996. Claire Stoermer, her mother, is of Scottish and German ancestry, and Kazembe Ajamu Coleman, her father, is African-American. Zendaya is the youngest of six siblings, and she went to Fruitvale Elementary School, where her mother taught.</p><p>Coleman first appeared in a play for Black History Month when she was six years old, and she later appeared in productions at the California Shakespeare Theater, where her mother worked as the house manager during the summers. Zendaya assisted in seating audience members and selling fundraising tickets, and her experience at the theater inspired her to pursue a career in acting.</p><p>Coleman joined the hip-hop dance troupe Future Shock Oakland when she was eight years old, and she also performed hula with The Academy of Hawaiian Arts. Zendaya appeared in several local theatrical productions while attending the Oakland School for the Arts, including “Once on This Island” at the Berkeley Playhouse and “Caroline, or Change” at TheaterWorks.</p><p>She studied acting at the American Conservatory Theater and the CalShakes Conservatory program, and she has appeared in many Shakespeare productions, including “Richard III,” “Twelfth Night,” and “As You Like It.” Coleman moved to Los Angeles with her family when she was in seventh grade, and she graduated from Oak Park High School in 2015.</p><h2>Zendaya Career</h2><p></p><p>In 2010, Zendaya began starring as Rocky Blue on the Disney Channel’s “Shake It Up,” which premiered to 6.2 million viewers, making it the network’s second highest-rated premiere since its inception in 1983. “Shake It Up” ran for three seasons and aired 75 episodes, with Coleman reprising her role in a 2011 episode of “Good Luck Charlie.” She released the promotional single “Swag It Out” in 2011, and she performed “Watch Me” with her “Shake It Up” co-star Bella Thorne; the song peaked at #86 on the “Billboard” Hot 100 chart. Zendaya also hosted the Disney Channel’s “Make Your Mark: Ultimate Dance Off 2011” that year and starred as Fern in “Pixie Hollow Games.”</p><p>She starred in the Disney Channel film “Frenemies” and guest-starred in “A.N.T. Farm” in 2012, and the following year, she voiced Lollipop in the film “Super Buddies,” finished second on “Dancing with the Stars,” and released the album “Zendaya,” which peaked at #51 on the “Billboard” 200 charts. She then appeared in the Disney Channel film “Zapped” (2014), guest-starred on ABC’s “Black-ish” (2015), and starred as K.C. Cooper on “K.C. Undercover” from 2015 to 2018.</p><p></p><p>Coleman starred in “Spider-Man: Homecoming” and “The Greatest Showman,” both of which grossed $880.2 million and $435 million, respectively, in 2017. Zendaya reprised her role as Michael Jackson in 2019’s “Spider-Man: Far from Home,” which was even more successful, grossing $1.132 billion at the box office, and it was announced in October 2019 that she would be returning for “Spider-Man: No Way Home.” She voiced Chris Jenkins in “Duck Duck Goose” and Meechee in “Smallfoot” in 2018, and she appeared in three episodes of “The OA” on Netflix in 2019.</p><p>She also began starring as Rue Bennett on HBO’s “Euphoria” in 2019, for which she won a Primetime Emmy.
