Brad Pitt didn't give up acting to become a beekeeper, for example, despite reports in the National Enquirer.

But despite the rumors to the contrary, it is clear that the actor hasn't quit acting.</p><p>The year 2020 was a quiet year for the actor as a result of COVID. However, McConaughey worked prolifically throughout 2019. He was then lined up to work on a few projects in 2021, which he completed. But, in 2022, McConaughey took the year off. As such, there have been rumors in both 2020 and 2022 that McConaughey is stepping away from the glitz and glamour of Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The turning point in this rumor came when McConaughey, who did some voice acting work in 2023, was named as <strong>the newest star to join the </strong><strong>Yellowstone universe</strong>. While it has yet to be confirmed just how McConaughey will be jumping into the series, the consensus around Hollywood is that he will be starring in 2024. This is especially true with Kevin Costner leaving Yellowstone to work on other projects.</p><p>Just when McConaughey's role will be announced is unknown. But what it means is that <strong>McConaughey is not ready to give up acting.</strong> McConaughey is just being particular when it comes to how he portrays himself on the big and small screens, having the luxury of turning down roles whenever he pleases.</p><p>Source: NW, National Enquirer</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdoq61wMeermalk5i8r63UoJ%2BesV2mwqrAjJqaraGenHqzwcyoqaxn</p></div><div id=links><a href=./golden-bachelors-kathy-swarts-dodges-questions-about-askn-drama.html>&#171;&nbsp;Golden Bachelors Kathy Swarts Dodges Questions About ASKN Drama</a>
