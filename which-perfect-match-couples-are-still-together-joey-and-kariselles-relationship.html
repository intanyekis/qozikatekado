During the Netflix reality series, the two seemed to fall in love right away. In fact, <a href=#>according to Cosmo, Kariselle dm'd Joey</a> in 2020 after seeing him on another Netflix show, The Circle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They supposedly dated intermittently, but The Circle actor apparently found commitment to be too much for him. On Perfect Match, though, there was an instant connection between the two.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/joey-kariselle-perfect-match.jpg><p>During their time together on the show, the couple did have some ups and downs. That is typical of most relationships, though. As it ended, however, the pair were head over heels for one another, which led Joey to get down on one knee.</p><p>"You’ve been my perfect match since the day I met you. I love waking up to you every single day, and I don’t want that to ever end," Joey told Kariselle. "I want to spend the rest of my life with you. And there is no one else that I want to go through life with besides you. Will you please marry me?" <a href=#>She said yes. So are they together today?</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title="Every Weird Dating Show Out There For One Great Binge">Every Weird Dating Show Out There For One Great Binge</a></span></p><p><a href=#>No. The couple has ended their engagement</a> after just a few months. In an <a href=#>interview with Variety, Joey said,</a> "Relationships in general are extremely difficult, and it’s hard to sit here and say exactly what happened because it’s extremely personal between the both of us. We have so much in common, but I just think that we really tried to do everything we could to work on everything. We both had the best of intentions, but we have a lot of differences that separated us."</p><h2 id=what-happened-with-chloe-and-shayne-on-the-perfect-match>What Happened With Chloe And Shayne On The Perfect Match?</h2><p>Chloe Veitch was from Too Hot to Handle and The Circle, while Shayne Jansen was from Love Is Blind. Regrettably, Chloe revealed <a href=#>in a Today interview that these two had split up.</a> She acknowledged that she got back together (or reconnected) with her ex, Mitchell.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/untitled-design-11-1.jpg><p>She stated, "I needed to date Shane and then date Mitchell to really see how different they were. Not comparing them to each other but more to my inner self. Like, how do I feel being with these individual men? Do I feel strong, empowered, loved, and cared for? And it really opened my mind to what I actually want in a man."</p><h2 id=what-happened-with-georgia-and-dom-on-the-perfect-match>What Happened With Georgia And Dom On The Perfect Match?</h2><p>Dom was an original member of the villa and made his first-night match with Francesca, a former contestant on Too Hot to Handle. During the next couple of matches, they stayed true to each other, but they did so in different ways. Teddy Bear Dom focused on their emotional bond, while Francesca was looking for a physical spark. Francesca made the decision to set up a meeting with Damian and explore the chemistry they seemed to have together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title="Who Is Francesca Farago's Pefect Match?

Georgia is interested in him at first, but she quickly loses faith in him because people in the villa are saying that he is not who he seems to be. Not only that, but his evasive answers when Georgia asked him outside of the show if he was in a relationship were not very good either.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/screenshot-2023-03-19-7-46-30-pm.png><p>Once all of that was out of the way, though, Dom and Georgia connected and created a solid bond together. While many thought it was a fake relationship, Dom had asked Georgia to be his girlfriend, and remained faithful when tempted by other women.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the end, however, Dom stated in a Netflix interview that their split came as a surprise because soon after the show ended—while they were still together, talking—Georgia went to do a certain podcast, and the title of the podcast (when it came out) was: Georgia and Harry Jowsey Fall in Love. He admitted being blindsided.</p><p>Georgia, on the other hand, said in the same Netflix interview that they were in two separate places in their relationship. "We tried to see how it would go, and unfortunately, it didn't work out."</p><h2 id=what-happened-with-bartise-and-izzy-on-the-perfect-match>What Happened With Bartise And Izzy On The Perfect Match?</h2><p>Even though they made it to the final, Izzy Fairthorne and Bartise Bowden were one of the more recent Perfect Match couples. They were extremely open and honest with one another about the potential difficulties that being separated would present for both of them, yet they still wished to spend time getting to know one another.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/untitled-design-9-1.jpg><p>Since then, Izzy and Bartise have been following each other on Instagram, but it seems like their relationship was just for the show.</p><h2 id=what-happened-with-lc-lauren-and-nick-on-the-perfect-match>What Happened With LC (Lauren) And Nick On The Perfect Match?</h2><p>As their business arrangement (strategy move) supposedly evolved into something more, Savannah and Nick's relationship threw us for a bit of a loop.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/untitled-design-10-2.jpg><p>It did appear, though, that LC and Nick had continued their relationship after the conclusion of the program, but it now seems that they may have gone on to other things.
