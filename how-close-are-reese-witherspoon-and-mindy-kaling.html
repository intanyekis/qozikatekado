Witherspoon shot to fame after starring as Elle Woods in the 2001 comedy Legally Blonde. Meanwhile, Kaling breakout came after she was cast in the hit comedy The Office. And while it may be assumed that the two women ran in the same circles, it seemed that Kaling and Witherspoon didn’t start collaborating until years later.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything Mindy Kaling Has Done Since 'The Office'</a></span>Since then, however, Witherspoon and Kaling have been working together more and more. In fact, Kaling was even tapped to co-write the third installment of Witherspoon’s Legally Blonde. Not to mention, Kaling has also been making guest appearances in Witherspoon’s The Morning Show. Clearly, they’ve become good friends. But how close have they really become over the years?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=reese-witherspoon-and-mindy-kaling-first-worked-together-in-lsquo-a-wrinkle-in-time-rsquo>Reese Witherspoon And Mindy Kaling First Worked Together In ‘A Wrinkle In Time’</h2><p>Perhaps, fans can credit director Ava DuVernay for bringing Witherspoon and Kaling together in A Wrinkle in Time. Kaling first met DuVernay at a party, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she never thought she would ever star in her film</a> since “our genres are so different.” “I can’t believe that I was selected to do this. It’s such an honor to act with all these incredible actors,” Kaling remarked.</p><p>As for Witherspoon, it seemed the Oscar winner said yes to doing the film the moment DuVernay asked. “It’s very flattering to be chosen to be part of Ava’s movies because she doesn’t just make a movie, she makes an experience for everyone,” the actress remarked. She also added, “I got to be this amazing celestial person, who hangs out with Oprah and Mindy all day.” It looks like Witherspoon and Kaling kept hanging out soon after.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=reese-and-mindy-have-been-collaborating-since>Reese And Mindy Have Been Collaborating Since</h2><p>Not long after, Witherspoon also ended up doing an unexpected cameo in Kaling’s The Mindy Project. “Our latest #themindyproject guest star is the only woman i would want to be trapped in a cave with. (This is weirdly the second cave we have acted in together!),” Kaling announced, along with a photo of Witherspoon on set, on Instagram.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Reese Witherspoon Made $15 Million For A Movie That Lost $72 Million, Here's What Happened</a></span></p><p>Meanwhile, Witherspoon also confirmed her appearance on the show by tweeting a photo of a script from The Mindy Project. “Is it possible to have too much fun on set? Exciting cave-dwelling things to come with @mindykaling and #TheMindyProject!” the actress wrote.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the show, Witherspoon appeared to Kaling while was in the midst of a crisis. “Snap out of it,” Witherspoon urged as she delivered some tough love. “I thought you were supposed to give me advice like 'I will find my one true love if I give up my big city ways and go back to my down home roots,” Kaling said in response, clearly referencing Witherspoon’s Sweet Home Alabama.</p><p>More recently, Kaling also surprised fans when she appeared on The Morning Show as rival anchor Audra during its second season. As it turns out, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Witherspoon used her connection with The Mindy Project to pitch the role to her former co-star</a>.</p><p>“My producing partner had worked on The Mindy Project, and we’re both really close with Mindy, and I did A Wrinkle in Time with Mindy, and then the part was just perfect for her,” she explained. “We were like, ‘Would you really do this?’ And she was like, ‘Yeah, that sounds like so much fun!’ So she came and played and gave us some of the greatest one-liners.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Witherspoon was also quick to assure fans that Kaling’s appearance was going to be limited to a single episode. “It gets better and better,” the Oscar winner even teased. “Wait till episode 5, it’s so good. She’s sort of Jen’s [Aniston] foil.”</p><h2 id=mindy-kaling-and-reese-witherspoon-also-ended-up-becoming-very-good-friends>Mindy Kaling And Reese Witherspoon Also Ended Up Becoming Very Good Friends</h2><p>It seems Witherspoon and Kaling have also kept in touch even when there’s no work to talk about. “We talk all the time,” Witherspoon even revealed at one point. And so, it’s no surprise that Witherspoon was probably among the first to learn that <a href=#>Kaling had secretly welcomed her second child</a>, a baby boy she named Spencer, in 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>All Of The Wild Alternate Endings 'Legally Blonde' Almost Had</a></span></p><p>Immediately, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Oscar winner sprung to action</a>, putting together a gift package that rivals any other gift Kaling received from other celebrity pals.</p><p>“I felt like the minute I got back from the hospital, there was a gorgeous gift for Spencer, with beautiful clothes and toys,” Kaling recalled. “And this is why you know a gift is from Reese Witherspoon — she also got my older kid something. My daughter, who didn't do anything, got all these beautiful clothes and toys, too.”</p><p>Not only that, but Witherspoon also thought ahead of time about what else Kaling may need as a parent to a newborn once more.</p><p>“And she sent us food, so we didn't have to cook for four days. So, that's to me just a very Reese Witherspoon-type present where it's thoughtful but in a very macro way,” Kaling said. “Like, she really knows what's going on in your life. That was impressive to me.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kaling is now hard at work on Witherspoon’s Legally Blonde 3. The writer/actress once revealed that it’s taking some time to complete because <a href=#>she’s determined to get it right</a>. Meanwhile, with The Morning Show renewed for a third season, it’s also likely that Kaling would be making more appearances in Witherspoon’s hit show again. That’s what friends do after all.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Who Was Greta Lee Before Playing Stella On 'The Morning Show'?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmLmwv8RmmKudXaeypr%2FEZq6irJiav7S8zqilZpmemXqutc2dsGajkaG2r7OO</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jayson-werth-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jayson Werth Net Worth | TheRichest</a>
