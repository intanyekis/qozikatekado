She rose to prominence in 2004 as a cast member of the iconic MTV reality television series Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>After the MTV show, she starred in various movies and series like Veronica Mars,&nbsp;Fingerprints,&nbsp;Dancing with the Stars, and&nbsp;Paradise Hotel.&nbsp;Subsequently, in 2018, she was&nbsp;granted her reality series, Very Cavallari.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Very Cavallari featured Cavallari and her then-husband Jay Cutler as she worked on Uncommon James, her jewelry line. Cavallari and Cutler ended their six years of marriage with a divorce in 2020.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After Cutler, she dated Jeff Dye for five months. Currently, she is <a href=# rel=follow>rumored to be dating</a> country singer Chase Rice.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><h2>Before Chase Rice Was A Singer</h2><p>Rice was born in Florida but grew up&nbsp;on a farm in Asheville, North Carolina. He played linebacker for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill football team, but he did not pursue an NFL career because of injuries.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>After graduating from UNC, Rice joined the Hendrick Motorsports pit crew as the rear tire carrier for Ryan Newman's Nationwide Series vehicle. He also worked on Jimmie Johnson's Sprint Cup Series vehicle and helped the&nbsp;team win two titles. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Rice is also a reality TV star. He was a competitor on Survivor: Nicaragua in 2010. He was crowned runner-up on the CBS reality competition show when he was 24 years old.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Chase Rice's Discography</h2><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Rice's discography</a> includes four studio albums, four extended plays, and ten singles.&nbsp;Rice started his music career in 2010 when he released his first independent album, Friday Nights and Sunday Mornings.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>He released his first six-song EP, Country as Me,&nbsp;in 2011. The EP was followed a year later by the full-length studio album, Dirt Road Communion. They did well on the charts, but a writing chance with Florida Georgia Line's 'Cruise,'&nbsp;drove his career ahead. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>It was published in mid-2012 and lasted almost a year in heavy rotation, topping the country charts for several weeks and reaching number four on the overall list.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Rice signed with Columbia Nashville and released Ignite the Night, his major-label debut, in August 2014. It&nbsp;debuted at number one on the country charts. Rice spent the next year creating a new album,&nbsp;Whisper,&nbsp;which was released in 2016.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Rice's fourth album, Lambs & Lions, was released in November 2017 after many delays, including a transfer from Columbia to Broken Bow Records. Regardless, the album debuted at number six on the Billboard Top Country Albums.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>In 2019, a deluxe edition of Lambs & Lions was released. In addition, his latest album, The Album, was released in early 2020 in two parts - The Album Pt. 1 and The Album Pt. 2.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Chase Rice's Past Relationship</h2><p>The country singer has two known past relationships — one to <a href=# rel=follow>The Bachelor</a> alum Victoria Fuller and an unnamed girl. As the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">singer told&nbsp;ET Online</a>, Fuller was merely a fling and not a relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>He had to confront Fuller on the Season 24 of The Bachelor when she was on a date with Peter Weber, and Rice was giving them a private concert. But, of course, neither of them knew they would be confronting each other.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>After Rice's performance, Fuller told the producers that the singer did not want her to attend the reality TV show. She then told Weber that she broke up with him since his lifestyle did not match hers.&nbsp;</p><p>Rice shut down Fuller's allegations and said that he never stopped her from going to The Bachelor. The singer’s latest album was released around the same time as his drama with Fuller.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Therefore, many speculated that The Album was dedicated to her. However, Rice cleared the rumors and said that The Album was dedicated to his ex-girlfriend and their messy breakup, not Fuller.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The singer was in a relationship with this unnamed girl for a long time. He was in love with her, but their relationship was "an absolute disaster in a fun way." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The pair broke up, but <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">according to Rice</a>, neither of them deserved it. Regardless, the breakup was messy, and it gave birth to the singer's latest album.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKOinsC1tc1mmpqukaG5or7IZpuarJmjtG6vx5qqnmWinrCmesetpKU%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./sex-and-the-city-star-cynthia-nixon-family-vacationing-kenya.html>&#171;&nbsp;&amp;quot;Sex and the City&amp;quot; Star Cynthia Nixon, Family Vacationing in Kenya (Photos)</a>
