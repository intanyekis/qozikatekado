Apple TV+ broke records for being the first streaming service to land an Emmy Award in a program category in only its second year of eligibility. The show and the cast are so beloved, so their salaries seem well deserved.

She won over the world with her portrayal of the sweet Keeley Jones in Ted Lasso. Her romance with bad boy Roy Kent has become one of the most precious onscreen relationships. Their cheeky flirts and witty banter are what makes this couple so endearing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The feedback that I’ve had from people that have watched the show and have enjoyed the show, talk about the joy that has brought them during this time</a>,” she told Access Hollywood. “I don’t know if this will ever happen again in my career, but I felt the same way making it.</p><h2 id=phil-dunster-1-to-5-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Phil Dunster: $1 to $5 Million</span></h2><p>Phil Dunster plays the epic football player Jamie Tartt, whose ego isolated him from the team.

Phil Dunster is also a recurring guest in Hulu's Catherine the Great.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Close Is Jason Sudeikis To His Ex Wife, Olivia Wilde?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nick-mohammed-1-5-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Nick Mohammed: $1.5 Million</span></h2><p>Nick is a British actor, comedian, and writer who has appeared in numerous sitcoms including Ted Lasso.

Don’t you dare settle for fine."</p><p>He wrote and appeared in the film SuperBob and wrote the Catherine Tate Live Show, and has also performed multiple solo stand-up shows.

Hannah portrays the vindictive Rebecca Welton who wanted to destroy her ex-husband's football club... and Ted with it. Her character ends up falling for Ted's charm and unbelievably pure ways and they end up being the best of friends.</p><p>Hannah has an unbelievable singing voice and was actually in musicals before joining television. In 2015, she landed the role of Septa Unella in the HBO drama Game of Thrones.
