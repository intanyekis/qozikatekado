The two met early in Lopez's acting career when he was an aspiring actor and working at Gloria Estefan's restaurant. They married in 1997 and by 1998 were divorced."</p><p>Interestingly, after the pair separated, they were still on decent enough terms for Lopez to offer him a job.</p><p>"After their divorce, she decided to hire him to manage her restaurant, Madres, in 2002. But she fired him only six months after he started working," Hollywood Life reports.</p><p>Over time, however, there have been problems between the two. Apparently, thanks to some iron-clad NDAs, many details of their romance can't be shared, and at one point, Noa and Lopez found themselves in a nasty lawsuit.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez Serenades Ben Affleck With New Song On Their Wedding Anniversary, Despite Contemplating Divorce</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=noa-wrote-a-tell-all-and-was-sued-by-lopez>Noa Wrote A Tell-All, And Was Sued By Lopez</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar52704253.jpg><p>It was revealed that Noa was coming forward with a tell-all book, something that would have violated the previously-mentioned NDAs that were part of his marriage to Lopez.</p><p>"Noa's plans for a book were revealed in a January 2006 article in the New York Post describing the proposed book as a 12-chapter "tell-all manuscript" under the title: "The Unknown Truth: A Passionate Portrait of a Serial Thriller,'" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a> reports.</p><p>The site also revealed that Noa was willing to keep the book under wraps, for a small fee of $5 million.</p><p>Instead of doing nothing and letting her ex win, Lopez filed a lawsuit against her former beau.</p><p>So, what was in this turbulent tome that was so bad?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"According to media accounts, the unpublished book alleges that Lopez had multiple affairs during her 11-month marriage to Noa, including one with salsa-singer Marc Anthony, her third and current husband," the site reported.</p><p>Not a great look for Lopez, and she acted quickly.</p><p>Eventually, the lawsuit came to an end.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez Hated Her South Park Parody And It Caused Members Of Her Team To Get Fired</a></span></p><h2 id=the-lawsuit-ended-but-another-was-around-the-corner>The Lawsuit Ended, But Another Was Around The Corner</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar52684006.jpg><p>According to CBC, "The arbitration settlement, reached in April, was disclosed Wednesday when Lopez's attorney filed papers asking that the judgment be confirmed. The singer-actress won $200,000 US in damages, and the rest in arbitration costs and legal fees. Lopez, now 36,sued Noa, 31,claiming he violated a contract preventing him from revealing private information about their relationship."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That's a big win for Lopez, who found herself on the defensive from her ex.</p><p>For Noa, this had to be a major blow.

Furthermore, he wound up owing Lopez a couple hundred thousand.</p><p>Most might assumed that things ended there between the two, but they would be wrong.</p><p>Years later, Lopez and Noa were back in court, and this time, Noa was looking to have their story turned into a project for Telemundo.</p><p>Long story short, lawsuits were filed by both sides. Lopez wanted to stop any stories from coming to light, and the other side claimed that Lopez had a hand in ruining them in Hollywood.</p><p>Per The Hollywood Reporter, Ed Meyer, who was in cahoots with Noa, "was going to get revenge by releasing onto the Internet â11+ hours of previously unseen home videofootage [sic] of Jennifer Lopez and Ojani Noa,â including (possibly) a naked Lopez."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eventually, Lopez had the last laugh.
