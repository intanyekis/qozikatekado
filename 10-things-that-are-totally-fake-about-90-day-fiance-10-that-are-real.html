for love is a common theme.&nbsp;This is the case for TLC's 90 Day Fiance, with a few unique twists.&nbsp;As the show’s website explained, “Using a unique 90-day fiance visa, the K-1 visa, the foreigners will travel to the U.S. to live with their overseas partners for the first time. The couples must marry before their visas expire in 90 days, or the visiting partner will have to return home.” Indeed, the premise seems shocking and almost impossible. But some couples do find love this way.
