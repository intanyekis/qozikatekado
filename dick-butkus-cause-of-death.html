I aspired to play linebacker for the Bears because of him. He was the ideal combination of player and individual. He was strong, intelligent, passionate, and modest. He was always encouraging and supportive. To me, he was a legend and a hero.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>Ray Lewis, former Ravens linebacker and Hall of Famer: “Dick Butkus was one of the greatest linebackers of all time. He set the standard for how to play the position with his intensity, physicality and instincts. He was a warrior on the field and a gentleman off it. He had a huge influence on my career and my life.
