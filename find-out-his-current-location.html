But what she actually received from him was a fatal illness. In “Evil Lives Here: Sleeping With The Enemy” on Investigation Discovery, Karim and Sarita’s relationship is explored along with how he withheld a secret from her, putting her life in jeopardy. As a result, we can answer your questions about what transpired and Karim’s possible current location.</p><h3>Karim Zakikhani, Who is he?</h3><p>Sometime in 2013, Karim “Tyson” Zakikhani and Sarita Anderson met while working as security guards at a hospital. He was initially pleasant and amiable, and in September of that year, they formally began dating. Sarita said on the show that she insisted on using protection when they had sex for the first time, but Karim hinted at having unprotected intercourse. In December 2013, Sarita wanted to have both of them tested for STIs as their relationship began to take a serious turn.</p><p>Sarita’s tests at the time came back negative, and Karim asserted the same. Sarita countered, “I never requested any documents. Just as he took my word for it, so did I. Then, in April 2014, she started getting quite unwell. She first started losing her hair, and as time went on, she began to lose a lot of weight. The visits to the hospital persisted until Sarita developed pneumonia in May 2014.</p><p>When Sarita first felt sick, she believed she had the flu, but the physicians were concerned. Then, in September 2014, a dentist found thrush in her mouth, which prompted an HIV test and a subsequently positive outcome. Sarita, who had been with Karim the entire time, confronted him, distraught. Sarita also discovered Karim had been married to someone else throughout their relationship, which was distressing.</p><p>Sarita discovered from the woman that Karim had infected even his wife with HIV in 2009. The investigation revealed that he had been aware of the illness ever since his March 2008 diagnosis. Sarita was stunned since before the diagnosis, Karim had taken care of her and reassured her that they would figure out what was wrong with her. Additionally, they had a kid together.</p><h3>Currently, Where is Karim Zakikhani?</h3><p>Following Sarita Anderson’s visit to the police, a complaint was made against Karim Zakikhani in June 2016. Eventually, the authorities learned that Karim’s actions had an impact on a number of other women. According to the program, at least 12 additional people claimed Karim had given them HIV. He ultimately accepted a bargain to avoid going to court.</p><p>Karim admitted guilt to the first-degree felony charge of aggravated assault on a family member resulting in serious bodily damage. Karim, who was 34 at the time, received a 30-year prison term in June 2018. According to prison records, he is still detained at the O. B. Ellis Unit in Huntsville, Texas. In 2031, Karim will be able to apply for parole.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrBorjKrKuonJGue6S7zGidoqaUYry2wIyhoKxlk6q%2Fs7HNrWSlp5OWwaq7zWg%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jason-kelce-celebrates-travis-kelces-touchdown-by-taking-off-shirt.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jason Kelce Celebrates Travis Kelces Touchdown By Taking Off Shirt</a>
