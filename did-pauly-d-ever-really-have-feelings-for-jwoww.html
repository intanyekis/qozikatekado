Now, we really are a family and we talk to each other every day even if we’re not filming. Nicole, she couldn’t boil water back in the day. Her idea of cooking was taking a pickle out of the fridge. Now she’s a mom and everyone knows I’m a mama’s boy, so every time I see them I’m very impressed. These girls have really grown up and its stuff I thought I’d never seen before. The same thing with Mike and his recovery, we never thought we’d have the relationship we had today. Everyone’s grown and we keep learning about each other because we’re in these houses for an extended period of time; we’re all we have.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With that said, certain components on the show just don’t change. One of them is the rumored romance between <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">JWoww</a> and Pauly D, something that has been brewing since the early seasons on the show. Things recently got flirtatious between the two during Angelina’s bachelorette party – leading many to question if something is there.</p><h2 id=jwoww-definitely-has-feelings>JWoww Definitely Has Feelings</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jenni did admit that her feelings for Pauly are very real</a> – she would even open up to the fact that the two when on a date following her divorce from Roger Matthews. Despite a fun dinner together, things got a little weird after;</p><p>“Me and Pauly had a nice dinner that night, then we went home together and he shut the door on me,” Jenni said. “I went back to his hotel room and it didn't work out like that. I decided to end it there. That was terrible.”</p><p>Despite the incident, JWoww looked very open to rekindling the spark on the show. Though fans questioned as to whether or not Pauly was just stringing her along for show purposes. That begs the question, was Pauly really into Jenni?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jersey Shore Family Vacation: 5 Ways The Show Can Go On Without Snooki & JWoww (& 5 Ways The Show Is Done)</a></span></p><h2 id=how-does-pauly-really-feel>How Does Pauly Really Feel?</h2><p>During the Vegas episode, he seemed all-in alongside Jenni – the two flirted the entire night and the rumor mill started to buzz. However, in the episodes that would follow, Pauly seemed very distant and kind of like he regretted the situation.</p><p>How does he really feel? The Jersey Shore star opened up with Us Magazine, stating that he loves JWoww, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">though he would never cross that line,</a> despite all the flirting from the recent season;</p><p>“She’s a great girl, she’s awesome,” he said during his visit to Us Weekly’s studio with his Double Shot at Love costar Vinny Guadagnino on Tuesday, April 9. “But she is like a sister to us, she’s like family.

Snooki and Deena were pushing for the two though ultimately, it seems like Pauly just doesn’t want to ruin the closeness. Reactions are mixed among the cast, though some agree with Pauly’s outlook.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best And Worst Relationships In Jersey Shore History, Officially Ranked</a></span></p><h2 id=the-castmates-have-mixed-reactions>The Castmates Have Mixed Reactions</h2><p>Although Snooki and Deena are all for the relationship, the guys on the show felt differently.

Ronnie wonders. "I would like to see it. I would like to see them hook up." "I mean, I don't know," Mike admits. "If things don't necessarily work out, it may cause people to start picking sides." "That's true," Ronnie acknowledges. "That is very true." "Somebody catches feelings, next thing you know, people are going to start picking sides," Mike warns. "And that may not be a good situation."</p><p>For now, we’ll continue on with the speculation, as fans are eager for a new season, which has yet to be announced. Fans are hoping to see the aftermath from Angelina’s wedding, along with a new chapter in the JWoww and Pauly story, which still seems to be a little undone.
