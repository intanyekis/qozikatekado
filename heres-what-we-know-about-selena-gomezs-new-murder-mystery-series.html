I was on a Zoom with Steve and Marty, and I’m like, ‘I’m not going to get any work done because they are just so quick in their back-and-forth.’” It seems like Gomez is excited to return to television and is excited to work with two legendary and hilarious actors.

There was no question except 'Can we get her?' We knew she would enhance the show in so many ways, the number one being talent," he told <a class=body-link href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue</a>&nbsp;earlier this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Her performance is rich and adult. She's learned to underplay when necessary. Marty and I are pretty manic, and she's this solid, solid rock foundation. She's nicely, intensely low-key."

This was revealed and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed to the Los Angeles Times by Gomez</a>, after paparazzi photos on set were misinterpreted by fans when the two were appearing affectionate.</p><p>She told the newspaper, ""We had just started working together," Gomez told the Times. "I honestly thought, 'No wonder guys don't want to date me!' I think people only care because I'm young, and the older I get the less they'll care. For now it's a part of the job that I don't really like.
