seen in the 90s. <a href=#>Pineapple Express</a> and <a href=#>The Hangover</a> are perfect examples of the shift that fans got to see.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2007, <a href=#>Juno</a> hit the scene in Hollywood, and this coming-of-age tale was a comedy that also dealt with heavy themes. Diablo Cody penned the brilliant script, and even though the movie has a cemented legacy, Cody has apologized for a specific line in the film.</p><p>Let's take a look at Diablo Cody and why she apologized.</p><h2 id=diablo-cody-has-been-a-huge-success>Diablo Cody Has Been A Huge Success</h2><p>Since breaking out in the 2000s, Diablo Cody has been quite the success in Hollywood. She has proven time and time again that she can craft a fantastic film, and her body of work is indicative of the immense talent that she possesses.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2007, Juno was just the tip of the iceberg for Cody, and she would go on to write a number of impressive projects. Cody has penned films like Jennifer's Body, Young Adult, Ricki and the Flash, and Tully. She is also slated to be writing a biopic on none other than Madonna, which should be quite the flick.</p><p>As far as what fans can expect to see in the film, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">EW</a> wrote, "Milestones Madonna and Cody discussed at the time included the pop icon's rise through the entertainment industry in New York City, writing "Like a Prayer," filming Evita, and her connection with Jose Gutierez Xtravaganza and Luis Xtravaganza, two members of New York City's Harlem ballroom scene that played a monumental role in the success of her 1990 smash song 'Vogue.'"</p><p>On the small screen, Cody has done some amazing work, as well. Cody has created both the United States of Tara and One Mississippi, and she is also serving as an executive produced on the upcoming Powerpuff Girls series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As great as it all has been for Cody, it all started with Juno.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'RHOBH' Fans Speculate On Why Erika Really Apologized To Sutton</a></span></p><h2 id=39-juno-39-was-a-massive-hit-for-cody>'Juno' Was A Massive Hit For Cody</h2><p>2007's Juno was a film that came from out of nowhere to become a pop culture phenomenon that rocketed to success at the box office. The movie's small budget didn't prevent it from making bank and leaving a permanent mark on the 2000s.</p><p>Starring Elliot Page and Michael Cera, Juno was a quirky offering from writer Diablo Cody. Focusing on serious themes while also injecting the right amount of levity, Juno was the right film at the right time for film fans. Not only did the film net fantastic reviews from critics, but fans genuinely loved it, as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the Oscars, Juno was up for some of the biggest awards of the evening, including Best Picture and Best Director. Cody wound up taking home the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, which was a massive win for the screenwriter and a huge feather in the cap for the film itself.</p><p>After all this time, Juno still has quite the legacy in the movie business. However, as great as things have been for the film, Diablo Cody has still taken it upon herself to issue an apology for a particular line in the film.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Lil Fizz Trolled After He Publicly Apologizes For Sleeping With Bandmate's Baby Mama</a></span></p><h2 id=why-she-apologized>Why She Apologized</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, why did Diablo Cody issue an apology for a line in Juno? Well, in the film, there was a pretty mean comment about music legend, Diana Ross, and Cody herself would go on to say that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she "felt bad" about the line</a>.</p><p>Interestingly, during a live table read of the film's script, Diana Ross' daughter, Tracee, noticed that the line was still in the script that she was reading.</p><p>"My God! You couldn’t cut it out for the reading? Seriously? That’s my mom for God’s sake," she jokingly said.</p><p>According to Mental Floss, Cody had opened up about the line while speaking with Vanity Fair, and she said that she thought that celebrities didn't have feelings when she penned the script. Clearly, she learned about this the hard way when she suddenly found herself thrust into the limelight after becoming a success in Hollywood.</p><p>Aside from the Diana Ross line, Cody has also talked about how she probably would not have written Juno in today's climate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I don’t even know if I would have written a movie like Juno if I had known that the world was going to spiral into this hellish alternate reality that we now seem to be stuck in," she said.</p><p>"I think I probably would have just told a different story in general. I wasn‘t thinking as an activist; I wasn’t thinking politically at all," she added.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Rejoice As B2K’s Lil Fizz Apologizes To Omarion On Stage For Dating His Baby Mama</a></span></p><p>Juno was a major success for Diablo Cody, but clearly, some elements from the film still weigh heavy on her after all these years.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Shane Dawson’s Apology Is Called ‘Fake’ As He Returns To YouTube</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbairsuoZJynlK56orzOpaagoaqasW6yzqtkraCZqHqrwc2oZKWhnpp8</p></div><div id=links><a href=./barry-keoghan-biography.html>&#171;&nbsp;Barry Keoghan Bio (Wiki)</a>
