They have been instrumental to her success, especially early in her career.</p><p class=dh>Beyonce has praised her parents several times in the past and has paid tribute to them in more ways than one, including her choice of a stage name.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/1e06d17b6431640db845fdabecec61e4.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Beyonce Knowles and Mathew Knowles during the UK premiere of "Dreamgirls" at Odeon Leicester Square on January 21, 2007, in London, England. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>While the world knows her as Beyonce, the "Single Ladies" singer's stage name is actually her mom, Tina Knowles-Lawson's, maiden name. Tina <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.oprahdaily.com/entertainment/a33482959/who-is-tina-knowles-lawson-beyonce-mom/>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"A lot of people don't know that Beyonce is my last name. It's my maiden name. My name was Celestine Beyonce."</p><p class=dh>Besides bestowing her name, Beyonce's mom, Tina, has always been a part of her daughter's career journey. She married Mathew Knowles, and together, they had Beyonce and Solange Knowles.</p><p class=dh>Interestingly, <a class="me a" href=#>Mathew Knowles</a> reportedly began courting her because he believed she was white. However, the couple divorced in 2009 after spending 31 years as a married couple.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/279b7336f5e4183b0f218a961ed343ec.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Beyonce Knowles, Solange Knowles-Smith, and Tina Knowles at a hometown screening of "Bring it On: All or Nothing" on August 2, 2006. | Source: Getty Images</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Beyonce's Parents Influenced Her Career</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Beyonce began her career at a young age, and her parents worked hard to make her name known in the music business. When her '90s girl group, Destiny's Child, came to be, Beyonce's father took charge of the singers' activities and became their manager.</p><p class=dh>However, when the group went their separate ways and Beyonce pursued a solo career, Mathew no longer played an official role. Years later, Mathew is still supportive of Destiny's Child and has shared his desire for the girls to reunite with him reprising his role as manager.</p><p class=dh>In 2018, Destiny's Child once again took the stage after several years apart. Mathew and Tina supported their daughter's reunion with the other singers and gushed about the incredible performance. According to The Things, Mathew <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thethings.com/beyonces-parents-continue-to-influence-her-career-choices/>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"[Their performance] shows how much they practiced, that ten years later, they cannot miss a beat.

While he and Tina no longer play manager, they continue to influence Beyonce's career.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Beyonce's Parents Divorced after 31 Years of Marriage</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Mathew and Tina raised Beyonce well, regardless of their marital status. Although the singer maintains a private life, with the exemption of occasionally writing songs inspired by life events, not much is known about Beyonce behind the scenes.</p><p class=dh>However, it was no secret that her parents separated in the late 2000s. In 2009, Mathew and Tina announced the end of their marriage but remained strong as parents, friends, and business associates. Mathew's infidelity caused the family to go separate ways, and he fathered two kids from his cheating.</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.tmz.com/2011/12/19/beyonce-mathew-tina-knowles-divorced/>According</a> to Tina, her marriage was "insupportable because of discord or conflict of personalities." Their divorce was finalized in December 2011.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/161d8e418188abf217d3643c628cd6e0.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Beyonce Knowles, Matthew Knowles and Tina Knowles during the "Beyonce: Beyond the Red Carpet" auction on June 23, 2005, in New York City. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>The same year, Beyonce professionally cut ties with her father, who had, until that day, managed her career. The <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.nickiswift.com/235334/the-real-reason-beyonces-parents-divorced/>decision</a> was mutual as Mathew shifted his focus to investing in Music World Entertainment's other genres. Beyonce <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/beyonce-and-her-dad-why-we-split-professionally-2011293/>said</a> at that time:</p><p class=dh>"I've only parted ways with my father on a business level. He is my father, and I love my dad dearly. I am grateful for everything he has taught me. I grew up watching both he and my mother manage and own their own business."</p><p class=dh>Many soon wondered what could have caused the rift between Beyonce and her father. A news outlet stated that Mathew took money from his daughter's world tour in 2011, causing a stir online. However, Mathew vehemently denied such claims.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>He shared a sweet gray-scale photo of Beyonce, sandwiched between her parents, who gave her a kiss on each cheek.

"Love seeing this in Seattle," she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bou6zeKBIJ6/>captioned</a> the post.</p><p class=dh>Mathew also took to social media to post a glimpse of the special day.
