Morphin Power Rangers</strong> was a show that undoubtedly marked the lives of the '90s and early 2000s kids. The show follows the adventures of a group of "teenagers with attitude" who are chosen to fight the evil alien sorceress <strong>Rita Repulsa</strong>, who has accidentally been released from her confinement and is threatening the Earth. The kids are given the ability to transform into a fighting force, the Power Rangers, and with that, they became the heroes of a generation of kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>All The Actors Who’ve Played Barney, Ranked by Net Worth</a></span></p><p>But what's been of the actors that made the show possible?

"It’s really cool how positively it affected so many kids. I hear stories from people whose parents were going through a divorce and it was their reprieve from that pain. I met this guy named Matt at the last convention I was at. He said when he was a kid, Power Rangers was his best friend because he was so bullied. Then he looks at me and he goes, 'Thank you for being there before I knew how to laugh.' It was just the sweetest thing anybody has ever said to me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She went on to star in Disney Channel's show Susie Q, she appeared in an episode of <a href=#>Saved by the Bell: The New Class</a>, and worked in the movies Perfect Body and Without Limits.
