And as she prepares to take on the role that was previously held by Amy Adams, it might surprise fans to know that Brosnahan has already amassed quite a net worth for herself before even starting her new DC Comics job.</p><h2 id=rachel-brosnahan-is-an-award-winning-actress-who-39-s-done-film-and-tv>Rachel Brosnahan Is An Award-Winning Actress Who's Done Film And TV</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rachel-brosnahan-on-the-set-of-the-marvelous-mrs-maisel.jpg><p>The truth is Brosnahan had been getting everyone’s attention long before she landed her role in The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. It all began when the Milwaukee-born actress made her feature film debut in David S. Goyer’s 2009 horror mystery, The Unborn.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Soon after, she also made appearances in various hit TV shows, including Gossip Girl, The Good Wife, CSI: Miami, Grey’s Anatomy, The Blacklist, and Orange Is the New Black.</p><p>Soon after, Brosnahan also memorably gets cast as call-girl Rachel Posner in the hit Netflix series House of Cards. Showrunner Beau Willimon initially didn’t plan on keeping the character around, but Brosnahan ended up becoming a recurring presence on the show until the third season.</p><p>The actress would go on to secure a guest actress Emmy nod for her work on the show. It also seems to have led to more notable roles soon after.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Warner Bros. May Have A 'Redemption Story' In DC's Ezra Miller</a></span></p><p>For starters, Brosnahan was cast in Craig Gillespie’s 2016 action drama The Finest Hours, which is based on the true story of the Coast Guard’s daring attempt to rescue the crew of an oil tanker that broke in half after it was caught in a blizzard in 1952.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from Brosnahan, the film also stars Casey Affleck, Eric Bana, and Chris Pine who portrays Petty Officer Bernie Webber, the man who was among those who volunteered to make the daring rescue.</p><p>That same year, Brosnahan in Peter Berg’s critically acclaimed film, Patriots Day, which recounts the horrific events surrounding the deadly Boston Marathon bombing and the violent confrontation with the two suspects that followed.</p><p>In the movie, Brosnahan, along with Christopher O’Shea portray real-life newlyweds Jessica Kensky and Patrick Downes who were seriously injured in the terror attack as they cheered on runners reaching the finish line.</p><p>And while Brosnahan had been doing more supporting roles up until that point, the actress soon nabbed the titular role in The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. The series tells the story of a mother of two who discovers her knack for stand-up comedy after her husband leaves her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Having never played any role like this before, Brosnahan wasn’t sure if she was the right person for the job at first. During an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with The Straits Times</a>, the actress recalled being “massively intimidated” initially, especially since it was her first time doing comedy.</p><p>It also made filming the stand-up scenes a bit more difficult. “I just remember getting up there and feeling so anxious,” Brosnahan continued. “Like I just wanted to sink into a hole in the floor.” She would go on to win an Emmy for her performance in the series.</p><h2 id=james-gunn-recently-cast-her-as-the-new-lois-lane>James Gunn Recently Cast Her As The New Lois Lane</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rachel-brosnahan-at-the-season-5-premiere-of-the-marvelous-mrs-maisel.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, the actress may have been quite busy with The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel in recent years, but Brosnahan still made time to go through James Gunn’s lengthy audition process for his upcoming film, Superman: Legacy.</p><p>Alongside DC Studios co-head Peter Safran, Gunn held several screen tests to determine the studio’s next lead stars, and in the end, Brosnahan prevailed, reportedly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">beating out the likes of Phoebe Dynevor, Samara Weaving, and Emma Mackey</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kevin Hart Put Way More Effort Than Necessary Into DC's League Of Super-Pets</a></span></p><p>According to Safran and Gunn, Superman: Legacy will center around the Man of Steel as he reconciles his Kryptonian heritage with his upbringing in Smallville, Texas as Clark Kent.</p><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">its official announcement</a>, the studio has also said that the film will kick off the start of a new DC Universe as part of Chapter One, Gods and Monsters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-rich-is-rachel-brosnahan-today>How Rich Is Rachel Brosnahan Today?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rachel-brosnahan-at-the-view-show-studios.jpg><p>As Brosnahan prepares to take on the iconic role, fans may be surprised to learn that the actress is already worth $15 million, according to recent estimates. Even more impressive, the actress managed to grow her wealth rather quickly, having only started landing roles in 2009.</p><p>Perhaps, her present net worth has something to do with her continuous work on The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. While reports indicate that the actress only earned around $100,000 per episode during the show’s first two seasons, Brosnahan’s rate has since been <a href=#>increased to $300,000 per episode</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is There Really A Rivalry Between Marvel And DC Comics?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from Superman: Legacy, Brosnahan is also attached to a couple more other projects. This includes the thriller Amateur. Directed by James Hawes, it tells the story of a CIA cryptographer who manages his agency into letting him go after terrorists who killed his wife.</p><p>Aside from Brosnahan, other stars attached include Catriona Balfe, Rami Malek, and Laurence Fishburne. As for Superman: Legacy, the movie is scheduled for theatrical release in 2025.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0edGamqGdnGKvs7vSp5ihmZ6oeq%2Bx02auqKqknXqxvsioqWasn2Kvpq%2FOpqCnn12hvKq%2FjKWYp51f</p></div><div id=links><a href=./danielle-bregoli-bhad-bhabie-woah-vicky-latest-fight-studio.html>&#171;&nbsp; Danielle Bregoli Looks Like She Lost a Fight Against Woah Vicky</a>
